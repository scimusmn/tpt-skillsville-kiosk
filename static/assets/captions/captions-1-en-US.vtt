Race and the wealth gap

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.260
If there’s one thing I’ d want people to understand

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.980
about the asset gap, the wealth gap in America,

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.300
is that this was a gap that was created

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.960
by public decisions for the most part,

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.340
by public institutions that gave

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.760
different opportunities for different people

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.880
to create, nurture, and gain assets.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.060
There's a long history in America

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.620
of explicit government policy

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.620
to exclude African Americans from

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:34.800
a piece of the pie, from wealth accumulation.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.800
It goes back to slavery,

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.040
where, by law, slaves, of course, didn't own their own bodies,

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.420
let alone other assets.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.640
Even after the Civil War,

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.080
there were policies like the Black Codes in the South,

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.820
which required enormous licensing fees

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.240
for blacks to start a business,

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.720
but nothing for whites.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.040
The difference between wealth and income

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.120
is really highlighted when you look at

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.120
differences among blacks and whites.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.440
While blacks have ten cents

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.740
for every dollar of wealth that whites have,

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.260
they have sixty-two cents

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.220
in terms of every dollar of income.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.760
So the gap for wealth

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.240
is much greater than the gap for income.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.960
So if wealth is important

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.300
for securing life chances,

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.300
then blacks have a very difficult time

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.120
doing that compared to whites.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.780
In the post Civil Rights era it's very difficult to

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.280
talk about race and class

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.800
as two separate entities,

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.520
because they overlap so much in our society.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.240
Many things that we associate

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.780
with race on the surface of it,

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.440
like differences in savings rates

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.020
or differences in education and performance,

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.020
are really class differences

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.660
when you get the data and compare

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.820
individuals coming from

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.820
similar economic circumstances.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.660
But the complicating factor is that those very

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.920
economic circumstances are determined by race,

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.500
through historical inequalities,

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.040
through contemporary dynamics

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.420
where whites get jobs

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.080
disproportionately more than blacks do

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.080
and other minority groups.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.760
So race matters,

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.880
but it often matters indirectly

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.700
through the class position,

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.340
the economic situation of a family.
